To find the test video used for this project:
- Our main video is the 720x1280 video which is 117 seconds long available at [this website](https://web.archive.org/web/20250814201136/https://sample-videos.com/).
- The URLs for our batch of test videos are in `video_representation_experiments`.

The main code for the experiments included in the paper is in:
- `video-trimming` (redactable signatures related code)
- `video-signature-verification` (code for interpolating video polynomials in circuit)
- `video-representation-experiments` (estimating the improvement from SFVR)
- `noir-video-editing` (implementation of video edits/video editing pipeline in Noir)
- `spartan-experiments` (experiments with Spartan for the appendix)
